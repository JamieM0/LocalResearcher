**Comprehensive Report: Formalization of Commercial Bread Creation and Automation Plan**

**Introduction**

The production of commercial bread involves a complex process that requires careful management of resources, tools, and human tasks. To achieve full automation, it is essential to formalize the existing steps in the creation of commercial bread. This report aims to create a flow chart outlining the necessary resources, tools, and human tasks involved in commercial bread production. We will also design a plan to automate this process, highlighting areas of research and innovation required.

**Automation Plan**

To automate the commercial bread creation process, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Implement Computerized Mixing and Blending**: Utilize computer-controlled mixing equipment (e.g., Hobart mixer) to ensure precise ingredient ratios and uniform dough consistency.
2. **Integrate Automated Proofing and Fermentation**: Employ temperature- and humidity-controlled proofing boxes and fermentation tanks to optimize yeast activity and dough development.
3. **Implement Robotic Shaping and Forming**: Use robotic arms or automated dough sheeters to shape and form bread with precision and speed.
4. **Deploy Advanced Baking Systems**: Install computer-controlled ovens (e.g., deck oven) that can precisely regulate temperature, humidity, and baking time for optimal bread quality.
5. **Develop Automated Packaging and Storage Systems**: Utilize robotic bagging machines and automated storage systems to streamline packaging and inventory management.

**Research and Innovation Requirements**

To achieve full automation of commercial bread creation, the following areas of research and innovation are necessary:

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**: Develop AI/ML algorithms to optimize mixing, proofing, fermentation, baking, and packaging processes.
2. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Implement IoT sensors and monitoring systems to track temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors in real-time.
3. **Robotics and Automation**: Design and integrate robotic arms, automated dough sheeters, and bagging machines that can work efficiently and accurately.
4. **Advanced Materials and Technologies**: Develop new materials and technologies (e.g., smart flour, self-healing coatings) to improve bread quality, shelf life, and packaging efficiency.

**Commercial Tools and Patents**

Several commercial tools and patents are available to support automation in commercial bread creation:

1. **Hobart Mixer**: A computer-controlled mixing equipment that can be integrated into automated dough preparation systems.
