**Comprehensive Report: Formalizing Commercial Bread Creation and Automating Mixing and Proofing Processes**

**Introduction**

The commercial bread creation process involves various resources, tools, and human tasks. To formalize this process in a flow chart and design methods for fully automating the task, it is essential to analyze the current state of industrial baking machine technology reviews, commercial oven features, specifications, and prices.

**Commercial Bread Creation Flow Chart**

1. Resource Management:
	* Ingredients (flour, yeast, salt, sugar, water)
	* Tools (mixing machine, dough handler, oven, cooling system)
2. Human Tasks:
	* Ingredient measurement
	* Mixing and kneading
	* Proofing and shaping
	* Baking and cooling

**Automating Mixing and Proofing Processes**

To automate the mixing and proofing processes, we will focus on the following steps:

1. **Continuous Mixing Technology**: Implementing continuous mixing technology can improve efficiency and consistency in bread production.
2. **Dough Handling Systems**: Optimizing dough processing using advanced dough handling systems can maintain dough consistency and quality.
3. **AMF Fusion**: Utilizing automated mixing and dough handling technology from AMF Fusion can streamline the process.

**Horizontal Batch Mixing and Continuous Mixing Technology Advancements**

To fully automate the mixing and proofing processes, it is crucial to advance horizontal batch mixing and continuous mixing technologies.

*   Recent patents and commercial tools:
    *   **Patent US 10,921,114**: "Continuous Mixer" for optimizing dough processing.
    *   **AMF Fusion**: Automating mixing processes in commercial bakeries.

**Implementing Automation at the Mixing and Dough Handling Stage**

To implement automation at the mixing and dough handling stage, we need to:

*   Evaluate the benefits of different mixing methods (batch and continuous) for quality control in commercial bakeries.
*   Develop a system that can maintain dough consistency and quality while automating the process.

**Economies of Scale, Improved Consistency, and Reduced Labor Costs**

Automating the mixing and proofing processes can lead to:

*   Economies of scale: Reduced labor costs and increased production capacity.
*   Improved consistency: Enhanced product quality through optimized processing conditions.
*   Reduced labor costs: Minimized manual labor requirements.

**Commercial Oven Features and Specifications for Automation**

For automating the baking process, commercial ovens with advanced features such as:

*   Convection and microwave cooking technology
*   Steam injection
*   Built-in catalytic converter
*   Structured Air Technology
*   Patented Jet Air System

can be utilized. Notable commercial oven brands include Cooking Performance Group, Doyon, Alto-Shaam, ACP Xpress, and Merrychef.

**Commercial Oven Prices for Automation**

The prices of commercial ovens vary depending on the brand, model, and features:

*   $4,899.00/Each (FGC200L)
*   $15,725.00/Each (JA8)
*   $13,493.60/Each (AR7E)
*   $13,365.60/Each (VMC-H3)
*   $10,999.00/Each (eikon e4-1430)

**Conclusion**

Formalizing the commercial bread creation process and automating the mixing and proofing processes require advancements in horizontal batch mixing and continuous mixing technologies, automated mixing and dough handling systems, and optimized commercial oven features.
